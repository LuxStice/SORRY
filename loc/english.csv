Parts/Title/rcsNoseconeXS,Text,,MIL-7
Parts/Subtitle/rcsNoseconeXS,Text,,osecone equipped with RCS thrusters
Parts/Manufacturer/rcsNoseconeXS,Text,,MILion Industries
Parts/Description/rcsNoseconeXS,Text,,"The MIL-7 was invented by Milfree Kerman, when his boss wanted something smaller than the MIL-14. The original design he proposed featured plastic components from a water gun, and worked surprisingly well. Those pieces are probably still there..."

Parts/Title/rcsNoseconeS,Text,,MIL-14
Parts/Subtitle/rcsNoseconeS,Text,,Nosecone equipped with RCS thrusters
Parts/Manufacturer/rcsNoseconeS,Text,,MILion Industries
Parts/Description/rcsNoseconeS,Text,,"The MIL-14 was invented by Milfree Kerman, inspired by an ad for exercise drinking cups. Milfree accidentally left some very small holes which caused it to spray pressurized monopropellant. He told his boss it was a feature, and thus wasn't fired."

Parts/Title/rcsNoseconeM,Text,,MIL-28
Parts/Subtitle/rcsNoseconeM,Text,,osecone equipped with RCS thrusters
Parts/Manufacturer/rcsNoseconeM,Text,,MILion Industries
Parts/Description/rcsNoseconeM,Text,,"The MIL-28 was created by Milfree Kerman after the MIL-14 and the MIL-7. Milfree at this point was a master of his craft, and he made a prototype in less than 4 hours. Coincidentally, all the planes in the VAB were missing their nosecone... odd."

Parts/Title/rcsNoseconeL,Text,,MIL-42
Parts/Subtitle/rcsNoseconeL,Text,,osecone equipped with RCS thrusters
Parts/Manufacturer/rcsNoseconeL,Text,,MILion Industries
Parts/Description/rcsNoseconeL,Text,,"The MIL-42 was created by legendary Milfree Kerman after the success of the other variants. He repurposed the leaking tank of a huge truck, and during the presentation he slapped it hard and said "You can fit so much monoprop in it!". It exploded."

Parts/Title/rcsNoseconeXL,Text,,MIL-56
Parts/Subtitle/rcsNoseconeXL,Text,,osecone equipped with RCS thrusters
Parts/Manufacturer/rcsNoseconeXL,Text,,MILion Industries
Parts/Description/rcsNoseconeXL,Text,,"The MIL-56 was made by Milfree Kerman after the disaster of the MIL-42, despite everyone begging him not to cause any further damage, but he just didn't care. He somehow obtained a submarine, and spent a week cutting it, creating this marvel. "




Parts/Title/gridfinS,Text,,WAF-001
Parts/Subtitle/gridfinS,Text,,Hypersonic gridfin
Parts/Manufacturer/gridfinS,Text,,MILion Industries
Parts/Description/gridfinS,Text,,"The WAF-001, designed to control your small-sized first stages during reentry, was created when two kerbals “accidentally” poured liquid metal in the KSC's waffle maker. The object was then used to heat up a waffle during reentry, which burnt it, but kept the craft steady."

Parts/Title/gridfinM,Text,,WAF-010
Parts/Subtitle/gridfinM,Text,,Hypersonic gridfin
Parts/Manufacturer/gridfinM,Text,,MILion Industries
Parts/Description/gridfinM,Text,,"The WAF-010, designed to control your medium-sized first stages during reentry, was invented after the success of the WAF-001. Its first test sadly resulted in a failure since it was used to toast a huge waffle using a rocket engine underneath, and wasn't cleaned afterwards."

Parts/Title/gridfinL,Text,,WAF-100
Parts/Subtitle/gridfinL,Text,,Hypersonic gridfin
Parts/Manufacturer/gridfinL,Text,,MILion Industries
Parts/Description/gridfinL,Text,,"The WAF-100, designed to control your large-sized first stages during reentry, was first made by KSC scientists to cook enormous rations of waffles for interplanetary trips, but it was then repurposed by the engineers for landing stages. Sometimes, progress requires sacrifices."
