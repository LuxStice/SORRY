Milfree quickly explained that the failed test demonstrate that “funny engine go brr” and “the design only needs very small tweaks” after his many heart attacks milfree went to the local arts and crafts store for some kerb-tape and kerb-taped so much of the engine together that you can’t even tell he found the vector turbo-machinery while fishing near ksc"
